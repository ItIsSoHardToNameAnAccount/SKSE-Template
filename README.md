- Forked from [SkyrimScripting](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_HelloWorld)

- Install [SSE Creation Kit Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061) and [SSE Creation Kit Fixes Update](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71371) (cautious do not install these two fixes with MO2, unzip it to your game folder)
- If anyone suffered from [FlowChart Error](https://steamcommunity.com/app/489830/discussions/0/144513248272527211/), open CMD, input "regsvr32 your\game\directory\flowchartx64.dll" should fix that.
